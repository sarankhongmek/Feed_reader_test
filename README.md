# About

This is a web application that reads RSS feeds. It's a project for the udacity front-end development. All file was already created expect for feedreader.js file. I had to create Jasmine tests within the feedreader.js file to make sure the application is working correctly.



# How to open

In the main folder open index.html it should open up in your broswe to view the application.



# View tests

Open the feedreader.js file in jasmine/spec folder (jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) to view and edit the tests.
